# FeedMe

Welcome to my third website!

This website was built as a **development milestone project** for the completion of the Data Centric Development module and it's part of the learning material for Code Institute's Fullstack Web Developer program.

A live **desktop demo** can be found [here](https://gaspar91.github.io/FeedMe/).

The **source code** for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/gaspar91/FeedMe).

# UX

This website was built to be a cookbook in order to help users to find and share recipes, and to inspire them to cook.

The website offers users the opportunity to discover recipes by searching for them in the main recipes page, and sharing their own recipes with useful points of interest such as what type of ingredients are necessary, the preparation time, its difficulty, a photo display to motivate the user to see the recipe, and necessary tools to have in the kitchen.


# Design Process

You'll be able to view the sketches, wireframes, and mockups for this project in the **static** folder in the [Github project repository](https://github.com/gaspar91/FeedMe).

I used [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) to build the wireframes, so you might need the program in order to view some of the documents.


# User Stories

### User Story One:

As someone who doesn't like to waste time with giving too much detail, filling up a short and quick register or login form is really nice and motivates me to do it.

### User Story Two:

As a user I want to be able to access, search and share recipes.

### User Story Three:

It's important to me to have my own profile page so I can see my own recipes.

### User Story Four:

It's important to know which recipes are mine and which are not, by having an edit button when I see all the recipes in the main page.

### User Story Five:

As a user I would like to add, edit or delete my own recipes.

### User Story Six:

It's important that the recipes have photos to help users to have an idea of what the dish looks like.

### User Story Seven:

As a user it is important that I have the necessary information to cook a recipe, such as what ingredients I might need, how long does it take to make it, the steps I need to take and for how many people does it serve.

### User Story Eight:

It's important to me to see what other users have cooked through social media, with images and other people's comments.

### User Story Nine:

Accessibility is fundamental for me, so if I can search for recipes when I'm walking or I'm far away from my computer I can just search for it on my phone or tablet.

### User Story Ten:

It is also important that there is a confirmation of what I'm doing, like when I've registered, logged in, added, edited or deleted a recipe.

### User Story Eleven:

It's important to me to be notified if the recipe I looked for doesn't exist.

### User Story Twelve:

As a user I would like to know more about what cooking tools are necessary to have in the kitchen.
